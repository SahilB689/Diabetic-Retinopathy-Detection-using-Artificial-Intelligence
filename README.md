# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Artificial Intelligence 

This project uses deep learning to detect diabetic retinopathy, an eye condition that can lead to vision loss or blindness in people with diabetees. Using retinal images, I trained a deep neural network model to identify signs of disease by learning from labeled example data. Through extensive testing and analysis, I optimized the model to accurately classify retina images based on the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy. The model achieved an accuracy of 83%. By creating an automated screening system, this technology provides a valuable tool for ophthalmologists to diagnose patients earlier and initiate potentially sight-saving treatment more quickly. The promising results demonstrate how advanced AI techniques can be applied in healthcare to improve clinical workflows and outcomes. This project gave me hands-on experience leveraging deep learning for medical image analysis and improved my skills in computer vision, modeling, and evaluation.
